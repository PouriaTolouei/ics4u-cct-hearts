To work on a feature, use: 
    - git branch branch-name
    - Do git checkout branch-name before modifying files (important!).
        - We don't do pull request for this project, but just for reference: Do git push -u origin branch-name to push your branch to remote repo

To merge your branch to your local master and push to remote repo, you:
    - git checkout master
    - git pull origin master (or just git pull) (make sure you're in master)
    - git merge branch-name
        - git branch --merged (to check what branch has been merged)
    - git push origin master (or just git push to push changes to remote repo)

To delete a branch locally or remotely, you will:
    - git branch --merged (to again check your branch has been properly merged)
    - git branch -d branch-name (to delete local branch) (be careful)
    - git branch -a (just check what branches there are locally and remotely)
        - git push origin --delete branch-name (to delete remote branch) (no need, unless you pushed a branch to remote repo)
